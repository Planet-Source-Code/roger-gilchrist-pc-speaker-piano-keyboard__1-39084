### Description

PC SPEAKER MUSIC KEYBOARD

ClsKeyBoardPicture.cls

OOPS! small upgrade. There was an error which meant a mouse move could change the duration value if there was too long between playing and outputing text. Also small change to the 'skins'.

The speaker I mean the thing that goes beep to give POST messages during bootup,not built-in's multimedia stuff.

This is a keyboard in a picture box class. It is part of a larger project but just to show that it is really free standing here is a small demo. The keyboard in this demo plays the PC internal speaker, and also outputs simplifed Basica and Nokia note codes.

The keyboard has 3 built in 'skins'.

Basica was a DOS ancestor of VB when the internal PC speaker was THE sound system, 16 colours was fantastic and 1 MB drives were a dream.

This is a sub-component of a more complex notation writer with error checking and auto-correction that I am working on.

Comments and votes welcome.
